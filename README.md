# NMPC_Differential_Drive_Robot w/ Obstacle Avoidance
This project is aimed to the solution of optimal control problems for a differential drive robot in an environment with obstacles.
in particular two kind of tasks are solved, point stabilization and trajectory tracking.<br>
Solutions to these Optimal Control Problems are found considering a Non Linear MPC strategy in order to minimize the power consumption of the robot and avoid possible obstacles in the environment.<br><br>
Two possible direct approaches are used with the N-MPC strategy :
* Single Shooting -> It takes into account only control actions as optimization variables.
Problem formulation

Problem formulation
* Multiple Shooting -> It considers also trajectory states as optimziation variables.

Furthermore a comparison between these two approaches is given. All solutions are computed by means of *fmincon* of MATLABÂ®.

## Trajectory Tracking
An example of a Trajectory Tracking, solved with Single Shooting approach, is showed in the following figure:
